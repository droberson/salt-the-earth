# SALT THE EARTH

I hate getting new workstations. It always takes me several
hours/weeks to get everything I need installed. This package installs
most of the tools I use on a Ubuntu machine using SaltStack. Hopefully
one day I will have time to make this work on other *nix systems
besides Ubuntu.

Currently, this is not anywhere close to being complete or optimal,
because I am using this project to learn SaltStack.
